React Technical Test
In this test I was tasked with building a page that sent a request to the NASA website and returned the images that matched that request. e.g. Moon would fetch images of the moon and display them on the page.

The page wass built using React.

Jest and React testing library were used for testing.

Packages used inclue Axios, PropTypes and UseSate.

If I had more time I would work on the styling of the page.
